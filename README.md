## Introduction
I've been developing a comprehensive billing application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). Itâ€™s designed primarily for freelancers and small businesses but is versatile enough to support various business needs. With this app, you can easily create and send polished invoices, receipts, estimates, quotes, bills, and more to your clients.

## Key Features
- Send invoices, receipts, estimates, quotes, and bills directly via email.
- Generate and email/download PDF versions of invoices, receipts, estimates, quotes, and bills.
- Set due dates for invoices.
- Automatic status updates upon adding a payment record.
- Payment history section for each invoice, including details on payment date, method, and additional notes.
- Record partial payments on invoices.
- Clean, intuitive admin dashboard showcasing key invoice statistics: total amount received, pending amounts, recent payments, fully paid, unpaid, and partially paid invoices.
- Multi-user registration support.
- Secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and Google OAuth.


## Technologies used
This project was created using the following technologies.

#### Client

- React JS
- Redux (for managing and centralizing application state)
- React-router-dom (To handle routing)
- Axios (for making api calls)
- Material UI & CSS Module (for User Interface)
- React simple Snackbar (To display success/error notifications)
- Cloudinary (to allows users to upload their business logo)
- Apex Charts (to display payment history)
- React-google-login (To enable authentication using Google)

#### Server

- Express
- Mongoose
- JWT (For authentication)
- bcryptjs (for data encryption)
- Nodemailer (for sending invoice via email)
- html-pdf (for generating invoice PDFs)

#### Database
MongoDB (MongoDB Atlas)

## Configuration and Setup
In order to run this project locally, simply fork and clone the repository or download as zip and unzip on your machine. 
- Open the project in your prefered code editor.
- Go to terminal -> New terminal (If you are using VS code)
- Split your terminal into two (run the client on one terminal and the server on the other terminal)

In the first terminal
- cd client and create a .env file in the root of your client directory.
- Supply the following credentials

```
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = 
REACT_APP_API = http://localhost:5000
REACT_APP_URL = http://localhost:3000

```

To get your Google ClientID for authentication, go to the [credential Page ](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) (if you are new, then [create a new project first](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate) and follow the following steps;

- Click Create credentials > OAuth client ID.
- Select the Web application type.
- Name your OAuth client and click Create
- Remember to provide your domain and redirect URL so that Google identifies the origin domain to which it can display the consent screen. In development, that is going to be `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:3000/login`
- Copy the Client ID and assign it to the variable `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` in your .env file

```
$ cd client
$ npm install (to install client-side dependencies)
$ npm start (to start the client)
```
In the second terminal
- cd server and create a .env file in the root of your server directory.
- Supply the following credentials

```
DB_URL = 
PORT = 5000
SECRET = 
SMTP_HOST = 
SMTP_PORT = 
SMTP_USER = 
SMTP_PASS = 

```



## Troubleshooting
If you're getting error while trying to send or download PDF,
please run the following in your server terminal.

```
$ npm install html-pdf -g
$ npm link html-pdf
$ npm link phantomjs-prebuilt
```

## Docker

Using docker is simple. Just add the .env contextualized with the docker network.

e.g:

> goes to path "server/.env"
```
DB_URL = mongodb://mongo:27017/arch
PORT = 5000
SECRET = 
SMTP_HOST = 
SMTP_PORT = 
SMTP_USER = 
SMTP_PASS = 
```
> goes to path "client/.env"
```
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = 
REACT_APP_API = http://localhost:5000
REACT_APP_URL = http://localhost
```

And run

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build

And then

docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
```
